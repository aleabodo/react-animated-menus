# Introduction

> This module extends **React Js**

React component that mounts three dot button that morphs into a menu by clicking on it.
Never ever worry about a fancy dropdown menu. This component does it for you!

# Installation

`npm install --save react-animated-menus`

# Usage

`import Menu from 'react-animated-menus'`

Component usage:

`<Menu width={"20px"} color="rgb(123, 192, 222)" />`

Replace `width` optionally width `height` but don't use both at the same time. 
To keep the ratio between height and width one has to be given and the other one is calculated by the component.

One example with height:

`<Menu height={"50px"}" />`

`color` is optional. The defaul value is `rgb(255, 255, 255)` if it's not defined.
